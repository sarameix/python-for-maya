"""

What Can This Program Do?
- This script is a batch renamer that finds a string within a file name and 
replaces it with another string.
- On the command line, the user must provide the directory in which file names will be changed, the original string, and the new 
string.

Instructions:
- Start the program by using the following format:
	python batchRenamer.py directoryPath oldString newString 
- This is an example of how a Windows user would use this script:
	python batchRenamer.py D:\Documents\ bb man
- This is an example of how a Mac user would use this script:
	python batchRenamer.py /Users/sarameixner/Documents bb man

Notes:
-If an incorrect amount of command line arguments is entered, an error message will be printed indicating the proper format, and the program will end.
